				<p>I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again. We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before.</p>
